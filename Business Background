Week 4 Capstone Project

Background: We are am international coffee store chain. Our main target customers are university students due to our affordable price.
We have decided to enter Indonesia and would like to start in the capital, Jakarta
Since we just want to enter, thus we would like to find university in Jakarta with minimum or no coffee shop exists.

Data: We will use Foursquare data to map universities in Jakarta with its surrounding coffee shops

Result: There is only 1 univerity in central location, and many coffee shops around there. Thus might need to reconsider opening another coffee shop
